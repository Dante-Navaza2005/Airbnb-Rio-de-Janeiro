Viviane is a photographer for Lonely Planet. And also a photographer for Airbnb and an Airbnb host. And a free lance photographer for other wonderful clients. She loves life.

Eduardo - you may occasionally bump into him for your check ins/out - is a M.I.T. (Musicians Institute of Technology) graduate from Los Angeles and plays the best guitar you'll ever hear. Just ask him! Fluent in English, a true carioca full of stories to share.

We  work together in providing the best accommodation to people. You could meet just Viviane. Or exchange messages with her. Or Katia.  Or you could book and meet Katia. Or book with Viviane and meet Eduardo for your check in. Or all of us depending on who's around. 

We're great at what we do because we care and we like the type of people Airbnb brings to us. And with almost 500 positive reviews (wow!), we kind of know by now that guests like us too. 

Just like you, we're also independent travelers always looking for the new next thing.

Voila!

We can't live without: love, travel, cameras, movies, music, a good laugh and cool people. Did we say dark chocolate?

Firm believers of positivity as a prime attitude towards life!

Sou carioca, designer gráfica, e acima de tudo uma pessoa que tem curiosidade e amor pela vida. Isto significa que gosto de uma variedade de atividades e assuntos. Amo fotografar, brincar de chef, ler, esportes ao ar livre, descobrir musicas e ritmos novos, amo viajar e conhecer gente. De tanto viajar por aí acho que aprendi um pouquinho do que a gente gosta de encontrar quando está visitando uma cidade como o Rio, uma cidade que amo!
Sou uma anfitriã informal e gosto de me sentir em casa quando sou hospede.
Assim, a ideia é que vocês desfrutem ao máximo da estadia no meu ap e na minha cidade.

My husband, Andre, and I have an amazing 5 year old daughter who is our everything.  

I first came to Rio in 2003 for work in the Fashion industry.  It just so happened my now husband was my then agent.  He showed me the local style of Rio and I instantly feel in love.  Well, at first with the City and the country and later him. : )  

I currently have a business teaching english conversation to kids while doing all kinds of American crafts, games, theater, and cooking.  I am also starting a professional organizing service as well.  My husband(Andre) has his own company for 18 years Importing and Exporting here in Rio.  

Andre, is a huge water guy, he surfs stand-up, Kite and short board.  He is a triathlete.  Needless to say we spend most of our time outside, at the beach or around the beach life style.  I on the other hand, love Yoga, meditation, cooking, gardening, a good book, dance, good wine, fashion, interior design and most of all travel! 

We are fortunate to be a family that travels internationally many times each year.  My daughter is already bilingual and working on her third language, (mandrin).  We spend most of our time here in Rio but also travel to the US, mainly St. Louis Missouri(where my family lives) and in Los Angeles (where I lived for 20 years).  We also travel to Asia regularly and plan to live there for 3 months this year.  

In one of my many past careers I was a professional Dancer and had the good fortune of working for a famous band.  I traveled all over the world for 5 years.  It was a special time and an honer and a pleasure to have the experience of knowing so many incredible placed and people.  It would be very hard to pick one but I must say the Magical Island of Bali is my all time favorite.   I am already planning our family trip around the world when my daughter turns 10.  

We hope to see you here in Rio Soon

Il est notamment connu pour être le quartier artistique de Rio; en effet, il y a beaucoup de manifestations culturelles organisées par les locaux et on y trouve un grand nombre de petits ateliers. Comme le quartier est situé sur une colline, vous profiterez de vues imprenables sur toute la ville, que ce soit la partie Nord (Maracana, Sambodrome ...) ou la partie Sud (Pain de Sucre, la baie de Guanabara ... ). Etant à la lisière de la forêt de Tijuca, vous serez surpris par sa végétation. C'est un petit village en plein coeur de la métropole, tel une petite île.

Nous n'avons jamais eu de problèmes de sécurité avec les touristes reçus (depuis 6 ans). Vous êtes les bienvenus à la Casa 48 pour changer d'avis sur les favelas et vous rendre compte que les médias et certains guides de tourisme en rajoutent un peu trop. De plus, les gens sont très gentils et chaleureux, il y a une ambiance très conviviale, comme dans un village, que ";"** ACCÈS FACILE EN TAXI / UBER / BUS  **  La rue principale du quartier, la ""rua Almirante Alexandrino"" est à 80 mètres de la porte de la maison. Vous n'aurez pas de difficultés pour prendre un taxi ou un Uber, quant aux bus, les 006 et 007 vous amènent rapidement au quartier nocturne de Lapa et au Centre ville. En bas de la favela, à 5min à pied, se trouve le quartier de Laranjeiras, qui donne sur la Zone Sud, pratique pour se rendre aux plages de Copacabana et d'Ipanema et rejoindre la station de métro Largo do Machado.

Lapa is home to samba musicians, capoeira players, and other marginals and bohemians and has been referred to as the ""South American Montmartre"". It still carries the soul of Rio in streets filled with music and the most interesting characters. Because of its location between the historical center of Rio, the bustling downtown, and the hills of Santa Teresa, it has always has a mix of people from all walks of life. Corporate office workers come here to drink during the week, while on the weekends it is taken over by all sorts of people looking for fun (from sambistas to rockers to playboys to funkeiros). And of course, there are the traditional families that live here and make up the bulk of the population on any normal day. Lapa is a small neighborhood so everything can be done on foot.

It's the only way to enter the building, meaning our apartment stays super safe. The building is on a quiet street between the two principal streets in Lapa, Mem de Sá and Riachuelo, close to everything, but away from the drunk people, loud music and piss on the streets that is inevitable on the weekends. __________________________________________;24-HOUR MORAL SUPPORT _________________________________________ We'll be in touch by email to offer you advice on places to visit, and tips on the best shows, gigs, or blocos happening in the city.

Amo viajar, especialmente para áreas urbanas. Eu também gosto de música, folk latino americano, jazz, rock e ritmos brasileiros como samba, choro, bossa etc, Também curto espaços culturais e de arte e costumo ir a museus, exposições de arte, ou apenas sair por aí andando e procurando algum graffiti novo pela cidade.

Hey ! Welcome! I am Fabiana, a 34 year old historian / teacher / tour guide who loves to travel, learn and chat. I always loved to share what I know about Rio history and culture,  discovering the diversity that this wonderful city can provide. This love became my job, and   I enjoy exploring the streets, listen to its music, know interesting people and discover the best places to live Rio.  
I have been an Airbnb host since 2011, when I started renting my family´s place for tourists and started my own small tourism business, Alma Carioca Turismo, where I offer culture city-tours and some great Rio experiences. It has been a great opportunity to make cultural interchange and turn guests into new friends I love to travel, specially for urban areas. I also enjoy music, brazilian rhythms as samba, choro, latin american folk, jazz, etc. I love art and enjoy going to museums, art expositions, or just walking around seeing some new graffitis at the city. 
Rio is multiple cities in this same city, with its welcoming people, beautiful beaches and mountains, historic sites and its vivid and pulsate culture.  I hope I can help you to enjoy your stay here.

Armin, November 2016: "" Staying in Jane's apartment was like staying with a friend. From the moment of the first contact, her helpful instructions to the stay itself it was like going to someone's home I felt very familiar with. Jane even helped me find my phone when I left it in a taxi.""

Mark, June 2016: "" Jane is a star host from first contact right through to being on hand to answer any queries before I arrived at the apartment and as well as being there during my stay.""

Maurice, June 2016: ""  Jane was an awesome host, She was very helpful with recommendations for tours and transportation. Thanks to Jane, my group had a wonderful time in Rio.""

Leandro, Feb 2016: "" La atención de Jane así como su calidez personal fueron sobresalientes.""

Dominik, Feb 2016: "" I stayed in Jane's apartment with some friends during carnival. Location was perfect and view from the room terrace was absolutely stunning! Jane was a great host. She made sure everything was perfect for our stay, gave us lots of useful information, helped us with taxis, and let us make late changes to our booking. Highly recommended.""

Assia, June 2015: "" Jane is very friendly and attentive person. She helped us in organizing airport transfers and city tours. Also she organized my surfing and art day. Her list of recommended places to try was very well selected. Jane is the queen of the Superhosts! Thank you, Jane!""

Cedric, May 2015: "" Jane was also very easy to communicate with, in fact she gave us an abundance of restaurant names and places to go out which we all tried! Thanks Jane for the amazing experience ; all in all, take care of the flat as I will be back anytime soon I hope!""

Frederico, June 2015: ""E o melhor de toda a experiência, realmente, é a Jane que e muito elegante e eficiente e facilitou toda a viagem""

Mehad, Dec 2014: ""Jane herself was INCREDIBLY gracious, super accommodating, and always quick to respond to our every request""

Tomàs, Nov 2014: ""Jane is the best host ever! She was extremely worried that we had a great time. And we did! ""

Diran, Jan 2013: "" Jane was of great help and availability throughout the preparation of the trip and once onsite. She made sure everything was as pleasurable as possible for us! Thank you Jane! My friends and I built great memories in your place!""

Wylie, Oct 2014: ""Jane was on top of everything!!""

Michelle, Oct 2014: ""Jane is simply the hostess with the 'mostess'! Always on hand when needed and made sure we were well settled and if we needed anything it was seen to straightaway. What more could you ask for? Just perfect!""

Giorgio, Feb 2014: ""Last but not least i was impressed about Jane; kind, friendly and always available to give me a lot of informations to enjoy Rio like a real Brazilian! I really thank Jane and i recommend her and her house!""

Guillermo, Feb 2014: ""Una excelente anfitriona!!!!!!! Desde el primer contacto fue muy servicial y dispuesta a informar acerca de su departamento y sobre Rio de Janeiro. Realmente muy agradable.
 Incluso frente a un problema médico de mi hija me brindó información sobre centros médicos.""

Richard, Nov 2013: "" And the hostess is the best. She lives outside Rio but can always be reached for information and assistance.""

Xaver, July 2013: ""Der Urlaub war super, auch der Papst war in dieselben Zeit da.
 Jane kümmert sich um alles und löst alle Probleme schnell . Wir sind sehr warmherzig empfangen worden.""

Tara, September 2013: ""I don't even know where to begin!!! We booked Jane's place for our television crew as we were shooting a travel tv show in Rio for four days. We had a fairly large group and a ton of big boxes with all kinds of equipment. Leading up to the stay, Jane was incredible. Not only was she easy to get ahold of, she emailed all kinds of suggestions and tips on where to eat, where to go, where to find the most 'visual' spots...you name it. The location of her place can't be beat. In fact, the pool area on the roof overlooks the Fasano's pool! Since it was Rock in Rio, we were actually able to use a zoom lens and see John Mayer taking a dip (don't tell him!) her place is RIGHT ON THE WATER..and you get a view of Ipanema beach, plus a view of the Christ. The apartment is beautiful...spacious, roomy and the master bedroom is off the charts. It's secure and the guys who work the front desk are fantastic. The best part about Jane is how excited she is to share her city with others. She gets such joy knowing you'll be there having fun. My only regret was that she was not in town while we were there. I will absolutely stay there with my family when we go back! I want to make sure I meet Jane in person!""

Lee, April 2013: ""I've saved the best for last: Jane herself. Jane was a gracious host, very proactive communicator, who made sure everything was perfect, before we arrived through until after we left. She obviously takes a lot of pride in her million dollar property, and she was like family. It was my wife's 50th birthday, and when we arrived, Jane had arranged to have a home-made birthday cake waiting, and even sent my wife a bouquet of flowers. She could not have been a better host. ""

Cynthia, Oct 2012: "" Words can't express how amazing my first trip to Brazil was and the perfect tone was set by Jane and her fantastic hospitality.I can't say enough about Jane. She made me feel like her home was my home and had excellent suggestions on what to do and where to eat. Her communications were clear and she always responded quickly to the hundreds of questions I had. A perfect trip, a perfect location and a perfect hostess! Thank you Jane!""

Thomas, Jan 2012: ""I had reviewed other rental sites and contacted the owners, some were helpful but I never felt comfortable until I met Jane.

The person that I meet here is different from the ones that I discover while I'm travelling. I live with a friend alone and we share the space with some intelligent life (plants and some small visitors). I am, indeed, a constant seeker. What I am seeking? That's the true question. 

In this search I found news and healthy ways of eating. Food is one of my favorites adventures. 

I also discovered that to eat I needed to plant. And that led me to permaculture, bioconstruction and all the old new ways of trying to live in a more sustainable way. My last interest is the world of soapmaking, natural extracts and other goodies for the body.

I studied Social Science in college to try to understand the world, our society. Now, I'm trying to erase all that to finally understand myself. I'm still a student.

I try to compost, recycle, reuse water, save electric energy and meditate. That's the way I found to reduce our impact at the planet. Here I cook, make bread and pizza, do exercises, read books, play music, clean the house, do gardening, make soap and try to be awake in the meanwhile. It's the adventure of being alive.

Meu nome é Brux e sou Italiano.  Estudei no Instituto de Arte na Italia e na universidade da Ciência do Esporte. Apos me formar, decidi me mudar para a Califórnia, onde eu ganhei um Bacharel em Marketing e fiz um Mestrado em Relações Públicas.  Foi chefe do departamento criativo e de marketing da Giorgio Armani em Milão durante 7 anos, e fiz consultorias para outras empresas Italianas e Americanas do luxo. Em 2007 me mudei para o Rio de Janeiro para relaxar.  Agora faço consultoria para empresas de moda internacionais que querem entrar no Brasil, para empresas brasileiras na área de imagem e marketing, e para pessoas na área de design de interiores. Comecei em Airbnb em 2010 como guest em São Paulo, e foi nesse momento que decidi que queria ser um anfitrião também. Comprei um estúdio e coloquei no airbnb quando em Ipanema havia 9 anúncio e no Rio cerca de cem, agora há quase 50.000.  Adorei a experiência e tenho acompanhados a trajectória de airbnb com interesse e emoção. Realmente gosto de encontrar meus convidados e dar eles dicas e truques sobre o Rio.  Mas nao e' sempre que consigo ... ai minha ajudante Rita os encontra para mim, ou também deixo as chaves em um Master Lock para permitir o check-in autônomo.  Em 2017, fui convidado a ser Líder do Clube de Anfitriões do Rio de Janeiro, juntamente com outros 2 hosts. Organizamos encontros, ajudamos novos hosts a configurar as próprias listagens ou preparamos listas de ajudas sobre como o usuário pode aproveitar melhor a plataforma. Foi uma experiência muito gratificante que me colocou em contato com a equipe da airbnb no Brasil e me deu acesso a mais informações sobre a empresa e seus acontecimentos. Tem sido uma viagem incrível e uma experiência que mudou minha vida.  Estou definitivamente feliz de todas as notícias e novos produtos que airbnb está lançando.

-----------------------

My name is Brux and I was born in Italy.  I studied in the italian art highschool and Sport Science University.  I then moved to California where I gained a bachelor in Marketing and took a Master's in Public Relations.  I headed the creative services and marketing department of Giorgio Armani in Milan for 7 years, and I did consultancies for other italian and american companies.  I then moved to Rio de Janeiro in 2007 to relax.  Now I do consulting for international fashion companies who wants to enter into Brazil, for Brazilian companies in the area of image and marketing, and for privates in the area of interior design.  I started on Airbnb in 2010 as a guest in Sao Paolo and decided I wanted to be a host as well.  I bought a studio and put in on airbnb when in Ipanema there were 9 listing and in Rio around one hundred, now there are almost 50.000.  I really enjoyed the experience and accompanied the airbnb trajectory with interest and excitement.  I really like to meet my guest and gives them tips and tricks about Rio. But sometimes I am not able... so my help Rita cheers them for me, or I use a Master Lock for self check in. Em 2017, I was asked to be Leader of the Host Club of Rio de Janeiro together with other 2 hosts.  We organize encounters, help new hosts set up their listing, or prepare how-to-do lists for user of the platform.  It has been a very rewarding experience that put me in contact with the airbnb team in Brazil and gave me access to more information about the company and its growths.  It has been an amazing trip and experience that changed my life and I am definitely happy of all the news and new products that airbnb is launching.

Vidigal is Rio's most;none;Vidigal is Rio's most foreigner-friendly favela community. It is relatively small and picturesque, and offers some of the best views of Rio. If you are feeling adventurous I recommend a 2 hour-long walking trail to the top of the Dois Irmãos (Two Brothers) mountain. The view is stunning and well worth the effort. Vidigal is very popular with artists, young Brazilians and foreigners. The streets are winding, narrow and steep, dotted with small eateries, bars, and shops. You are sure to get a good workout whether going up or down!  During the day the streets are teaming with merchants, moto taxis and residents going about their business. One could spend hours watching the interesting life here from one of the many restaurants just a short stroll away. At night there are a selection of bars to sample. You are walking distance from the Vidigal beach at the Sheraton Hotel. It takes roughly 15 minutes to walk to it. Ipanema and Leblon beaches are a short distance away, again walkable (35 min;As this is a shared residential property, parties and extra guests are prohibited.   There are 5 friendly dogs living on the property. If you dislike dogs this is probably not the best choice for you.;From the Airport: You cannot call an Uber from the Airport so the next best option is a taxi.  Make sure you choose a certified taxi and get clarification on the fare. At times taxis are reluctant to go up the narrow Vidigal streets but my street is only the 2nd right off of the main winding road. During your stay in Vidigal if you get tired of walking up and down you can use the Moto Taxi which offer a fast and inexpensive service at a price of 5 reais per person (Jan 2016) or alternatively a van/kombi (official transportation vans).;;;Nenhum animal de estimação, por favor Não se aceitam visitantes ou festas O check-in às 13: 00h Check-out às 12h00;;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16106390/32543fca_original.jpg?aki_policy=large;;1194918;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1194918;Sonia Gallo;2011-09-22;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;"Originally from Sao Paulo, Vidigal has been my home for the last 30 years.

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

That's also where we first lived when we got married 4 years ago. That's when we renovated the place. We spent a wonderful time there and we definitely have many cherrishble memories about it. 

In 2011 we spent 2 weeks in Paris in a rented apartment. We loved the experience because it was cozy, it was charming, it made us feel like we were one of the locals and it was also cheaper than a hotel. Then, later that same year we moved to another place, and based on our wonderful experience in Paris, we decided to rent our apartment.

We hope you can feel as good and have a memorable time in it, just like we did.

 WHY CHOOSE BOTAFOGO ?

Rio has several neighborhoods. The best five includes Botafogo.
Doubtless more secure than Ipanema. Better value for money compares to Leblon. No so crowded as Copacabana.

Botafogo is compared to Local’s East Village ( N.Y). Imagine a charming, completely local, miscellaneous stores (  The biggest mall, high bakeries, premium and cheap supermarkets,  young bars, amazing-closed public garden, banks and juicy local’s stores. Don’t waste your time. Booking now!

KEEP IN MIND.

Rio is not ready for an international big event or foreigner experience. The city is most Portuguese informed. Choosing a polyglot Senior Host guarantees you always be safe in the city. Sometimes, you’ll have a cheaper place, but no secure.  Think about that.

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

We have tried to move out a couple of times, but we just can't. Nowhere else in Rio you'll find this sweet neighborhood feeling, in which you enter bars and cafes and feel you're entering a friend's place. The little plaza just outside our door is where families and friends gather at night, grab a beer and a pizza, and enjoy our lovely weather. We're also strategically located, right atop the city's historic and financial and cutural center (Lapa).;;There's a bus line that passes right in front of our house and takes you downtown (it's a 20 minute ride). There's also a volkswagen van regular line (until 11pm) that takes you to the subway, in the Gloria neighborhood. You can also walk down the stairways to Bairro de Fatima (10 minute walk) and catch a bus to literally any neighborhood in Rio.  Sometimes cab drivers will refuse a ride up to Santa Teresa. They say it's because of the tram tracks (it's supposed to damage their tires) but the truth is that it takes a little while to climb the hill, and the ride is too cheap (R$10 to R$15 from downtown or Lapa), so they don't find it worth it. But after a couple of attempts, there's always a cab to come up at night.

Hey ! Welcome! I am Fabiana, a 34 year old historian / teacher / tour guide who loves to travel, learn and chat.

This love became my job, and   I enjoy exploring the streets, listen to its music, know interesting people and discover the best places to live Rio.  
I have been an Airbnb host since 2011, when I started renting my family´s place for tourists and started my own small tourism business, Alma Carioca Turismo, where I offer culture city-tours and some great Rio experiences. It has been a great opportunity to make cultural interchange and turn guests into new friends I love to travel, specially for urban areas. I also enjoy music, brazilian rhythms as samba, choro, latin american folk, jazz, etc. I love art and enjoy going to museums, art expositions, or just walking around seeing some new graffitis at the city.

I'm pretty much an organized person who likes the house to be fresh and clean so I appreciate people not to wear shoes inside the house. Overall I'm a relaxed and easygoing person as you will find out by yourself.
Hope to see you in Rio!

Studied at art college in England (Bath Academy of Art) and was later invited to Brazil by Museum of Modern Art (Rio de Janeiro), on a scholarship. Built my own house in Rio.
I teach at the School of Visual Arts in Rio de Janeiro and lecture around the country to universities, cultural Institutions and companies, on ""Creative Thinking and Problem Solving"". At present writing a book on the subject.
I am also Director of ""Dynamic Encounters"" International Art Workshops, project involved in interviewing creative personalities around the world.

My main hobby (non educational) is boatbuilding and sailing. 
I build wooden sailing boats and sail around the Guanabara Bay area.
Others hobbies include reading and research, building my house. Hobbies are so tied up with work that it's kind of difficult to separate them.

I grew up in Copacabana.  From the 70´s I saw big transitions in my town.  In 2005, I decided to make a big change in my life and left a partnership on a Mexican food business to go on tourism. It was not easy to leave everything  behind and at the age of 42 go to a new career.

Today I am absolutely sure I did the best working decision of my life. I love my life and enjoy to meet new people every day. At the same time that I am giving information, I get to learn a lot from my clients.

I have been receiving over 200 people every year and also renting 70% of the apartments I manage. I am sure that at the end of your vacation you will not only miss Rio, but will have made a new friend.

When I was younger I used to spent a lot of time on  the beach. Even during stormy days I was able to swim and relax in a place that, to me, is the most peaceful place on earth: the Atlantic ocean. Nowadays, I still go body surfing, but not like I did before.

Hoping to meet you,

Rogerio

Damage caused by the behavior of a Tenant, or a Tenant’s guest, will be repaired at the Tenant’s expense. We can make arrangements to receive the guest(s) at the airport (check availability) or at the apartment, on check-in, to hand over the keys.  It is the Tenant’s responsibility to return keys at check-out. Os vizinhos precisam ser respeitados, então sem barulhos muito altos após as 22hrs.

I grew up in Copacabana.  From the 70´s I saw big transitions in my town.  In 2005, I decided to make a big change in my life and left a partnership on a Mexican food business to go on tourism. It was not easy to leave everything  behind and at the age of 42 go to a new career.

Today I am absolutely sure I did the best working decision of my life. I love my life and enjoy to meet new people every day. At the same time that I am giving information, I get to learn a lot from my clients.

I have been receiving over 200 people every year and also renting 70% of the apartments I manage. I am sure that at the end of your vacation you will not only miss Rio, but will have made a new friend.

When I was younger I used to spent a lot of time on  the beach. Even during stormy days I was able to swim and relax in a place that, to me, is the most peaceful place on earth: the Atlantic ocean. Nowadays, I still go body surfing, but not like I did before.

Hoping to meet you,

Rogerio

We have spectacular sunrises and sunsets from our window, but it is so easy to walk a few minutes to watch the sunset over Ipanema.  Everything in  Ipanema and Copacabana is accessible just by walking. Ipanema is so charming, and Copacabana is 24-7, with lots of nightlife, and so many beach activities. I am here 3 months out of the year, and I rarely need to get into a taxi or metro.  One of my favorite things to do is hike to the top of Fort Leme which is at the end of Copacabana.  This is a protected and very safe area, and you can walk up to the top for a phenomenal view of Rio, Copacabana, and Sugarloaf -- and you are most likely to have it nearly all to yourself!  It's so easy to walk or run miles in both directions, as well as swim, and surf.  Our apt looks down on a paddleboarding school, as well as another for Beach Volleyball. It's so easy t;If you didn't even leave my apartment, amazingly you could have a good trip to Rio, and still see a LOT!!  But, of course you will be out and about. Staying here will ensure you really do get the most out of your stay in Rio, both night and day.  I work from my computer here for 3 months of the year, and it is wonderful to look up and see the beach, and Sugarloaf, and hear the waves all day.  I can even see Copacabana Beach in the mirror as I shave!  You will definitely not only experience Rio to the fullest, you will feel a part of our magical city! Our electrical outlets supply the same current as the U.S. and accommodate plugs for both Brazilian, and all American appliances.  We buy virtually all our electrical equipment and appliances in the U.S. and bring them to Rio.;It's less than 5 minutes walk to the Metro Station General Osorio, and the Metro will take you to the downtown business district, ferry and bus terminals, and to just about everywhere you will want to go.  Buses that will also take you nearly everywhere are also at the back entrance of our building at Ave. Copacabana.  Of course, taxis are easy to catch and ubiquitous in my neighborhood. But most importantly it is so easy to walk to so many of the things you will want to see, so you will need to spend by far less time getting to places -- you are already there!;The beach is just out the door, and you will find our apartment is so convenient to everything you will need.  Within one block you will find banks, ATMs, supermarkets, juice bars, a delightful European bakeries, Oceanside dining, many bars, pharmacies, newsstands, clothing shops, and a two gyms.

First of all, we like people!

I am specialized in administration, management of processes of change in companies rendering services and in industries, particularly in administrative and information processes, and in processes related to production or rendering of services, and to the human factor, especially focusing on results, and the implementation of systems of quality management, as per ISO (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , showing my performance in administration with a strong profile as regards management of processes, the human factor and technology.

My professional experience has made me specialize in the creation and implementation of private companies (a profession known as Start-up Manager), both medium and large, located in Uruguay, Chile and Brazil. My education is based on administrative science, management of projects and implementation of systems of quality management. In addition, I have carried out consultancy work, management of projects and education/training for Uruguayan, French, German and Chilean NGO’s, between 1986 and 1990. In 1998 I was the founding director of Rio Cristal S.A., a company that renders services related to the human factor, based on information technology and the Internet, located in Montevideo/Uruguay.

Since 2002, I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

In 2006 I created BabelTeam ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) a company that aims to help other companies, projects and individuals to communicate with the increasing market of consumers who use the Internet as a source of information to their decision-making processes.

Hosting is something I really enjoy doing. The attention I give to my guests, I do with passion. I believe the secret to be a successful host is to love what you do. In fact, I put a lot of my time to make sure my apartment is a welcoming place for everyone who wants to stay there, making their stay an unforgettable time in Rio. 
Personally, I like to travel the world, as a result, I have an understanding of what is important to someone when it comes to explore another city. For example, going to the right places at the right time, getting some deals and exploring places where only local would know about it, making their trip extra special.
I enjoy taking the time to think about little details. e.g. providing a city map, preparing the apartment with fruits and treats, as well as being available to all my guests all the time not only to answer questions but also to give last minute suggestions.
 I am available to help my future guests in customizing their vacation based on their needs and interest.
Be one of my guests, send me a message. I am looking forward to welcoming you in Rio too.

I'm an original Carioca, born and raised in Leblon, right now living in Gávea.

I love getting in touch with different cultures and share experiences and ideas. I like to travel a lot, bike, run, work-out, watch UFC, relax at the beach and a good cold beer in Baixo Gávea.

I'm a very informal person and host, a huge fan of Rio and i invite you to come to this amazing city and stay in one of my places.

I try to offer the best support for those who come to my proprieties. The same support that i would like to receive when I’m travelling. 
I´m a fan of Rio de Janeiro and hope you enjoy as much as i do! 

Once in Rio, if you have some time you should go to Búzios, Ilha Grande and Visconde de Mauá (Maromba and Maringá), places that I like so much!

Some comments from my guests: 

- Diogo is really friendly and helpful host, I can without a doubt recommend his service to my friends and anyone. Our experience in Rio was smooth and enjoyable thanks to him! (Timur from Ukraine)
- Diogo was an awesome host in an incredible city! He was very kind and the apartment was very clean, and all of the conveniences one would want while staying away from home: bedding, linens, TV & DVDs, wifi, laundy, etc. Diogo took time to check us into the property, give us a list of things to do and see and eat, had a map for us, and took care of EVERYTHING! If you are looking for a nice, clean, safe place to stay in Rio, then this is the spot! (Justin Lee from Canada)
- Diogo was a fantastic host and was ready to help at any point in time. We were able to communicate through (Hidden by Airbnb) and provided advice and answered questions I had about Rio. The apartment was what we expected and advertised. Fantastic location and not too big. It was clean and had towels, sheets, etc. What was a big surprise was the fact that Diogo had stocked the place with some snacks, beer, soda, etc. It was a really great surprise and something I was not expecting. The wireless internet, TV, radio, etc. all had clear instructions which was fantastic. I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family (Chris Whittam from USA)
- Diogo is an amazing host. He made sure the apartment was clean and everything was well explained. He helped with suggestions for places to eat and go out, and he was very flexible letting us stay late when our flight was delayed. The apartment is in a prime location in the middle of iconic Ipanema - only 1 block from the beach. It very comfortably fit 8 and had a nice common area that accommodated us all as well ( Robbie from USA).";within a few hours;97%;;f;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/eeaa0cd1-4436-44c6-b986-13a955e76d81.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/eeaa0cd1-4436-44c6-b986-13a955e76d81.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;Leblon;50.0;50.0;['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id'];t;t;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;Leblon;Leblon;;Rio de Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro;22430-170;Rio De Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;BR;Brazil;-22.98176138103282;-43.22190013686867;t;Apartment;Entire home/apt;10;2.5;3.0;5.0;Real Bed;"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free parking on premises"",""Smoking allowed"",""Pets allowed"",Doorman,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Pack ’n Play/travel crib"",""Hot water"",""Host greets you""}";0.0;$201.00;;;$900.00;$160.00;2;$50.00;2;365;today;t;28;52;82;175;2018-04-14;83;2012-04-25;2018-03-23;93.0;10.0;9.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;9.0;f;;;t;f;strict;f;f;47;1.14;4;2018;;;;;;;;;;

In the main street there are bus stops to South and North zones where you can get to Christ the statue e.g. in 20 minutes. To Sugar Loaf you can take subway + connection bus and get there in 30min or walk 10minutes and get a bus that goes straight there in 20minutes. There's Flamengo beach in walking distance but it's not v good to swim. Also Gloria marina where once in a while there are parties and some festivals and on Sundays all highways in that area (Aterro do Flamengo) are closed for recreation and leisure. You can take a VW bus to go to Santa Teresa, a district with a lot of good restaurants and museums (and graffiti for those who like it) and some of the most beautiful;"PLEASE HAVE IN MIND THAT If you bring a visitor without my consent, you'll be asked to leave the apartment immediately without any refund. So, by booking my place for your stay, you agree with this ""rule"". Important: Check in and check out can be flexible! However I'll let you know if I have guests leaving on the day you arrive and/or arriving on the day you leave.  If yes, check in is at 1pm. But if there's nobody staying in my extra room the previous night, no problem with getting here earlier than that. Check out is at 11am. If I have someone coming on the day you're leaving, you must leave the room at that time. Unfortunately, You cannot leave the bags at the apartment to pick up later as I won't have keys available for you to come back and I will probably won't be at the apartment during the day.";;Other stuffs: The use of the washing machine is NOT allowed. There is a laundromat one block away from the apartment. You can use everything in the kitchen (fridge, oven, stove, microwave and utensils) -  not my food, obviously. You'll find two small couches and a dining table in the living room. You have TV in your room with cable TV. Sometimes there's a TV in the living room, sometimes not. If you have a wifi device (laptop, iphone) there's wifi in the apartment. Linen and towel are included. Unfortunately I don't offer breakfast but there are juice shops in the main street or you can buy food/drinks in the market, stock it and prepare in the morning.;About me and friends: My place has 3 rooms: one that I rent, one that I live  and another one that my friend lives (when he's in Rio) or that I rent on Airbnb too.** So you may share the apartment with me and one other person!   My apt is gay friendly and we are smokers (we smoke in the living room sometimes).  Sometimes friends come over (eat, drink, etc before going out) and sometimes they sleep over too. They're usually talkative, easygoing, Xfactor fans..  but want you to know it before booking my/your room! So this is kinda important to some people: if youre looking for company to do stuffs or someone to chat about your day, this is not the best place for you! Sorry!  I go to uni really early in the morning and after that I go to work until the evening so you won't see me much and if you do, I'm probably passing out tired.

I have been living in Brazil for about four years and before that was a regular visitor to these shores for a number of years. I used to have an apartment in Salvador da Bahia which I often rented out as a furnished holiday apartment to visitors from all over the world, so I think I have a good idea of what it takes to create a comfortable and welcoming home-from-home and the importance of taking care of the small details which make the difference between an average holiday apartment rental and a really good one.
I have travelled extensively and lived in the UK, the US and South Africa before finally coming to rest in the ´´cidade maravilhosa´´ with its breathtaking scenery, wonderful climate and a warm and friendly people. These days, I make my living as an English teacher in Rio and have no plans to move on  - unless the travel bug bites again!

My name is Elisa. 
I'm passionate about travelling, music and learning from different cultures!

Oi!

Sou apaixonada por viagens, música e aprender sobre diferentes culturas.

Em 2012 eu decidi começar a alugar meu apartamento aqui no AirBnb para dar a oportunidade de mais pessoas se encantarem com o Rio além de mim!

=========================================================Sou o Vinicius ,  atualmente mora na Ilha da Gigoia, lugar paradisíaco na Barra da Tijuca,  no Rio de Janeiro / Rj / Brasil e sou anfitrião da Airbnb desde 2012 alugando casa e  quartos nas Ilhas Primeira e Gigoia, no belíssimo complexo lagunar da Barra da Tijuca. Tenho também opções em toda a Zona Sul do Rio de Janeiro e também na Zona Norte. Eu não moro nas casas que alugo , portanto você ficara com toda a casa a sua disposição.

The person that I meet here is different from the ones that I discover while I'm travelling. I live with a friend alone and we share the space with some intelligent life (plants and some small visitors). I am, indeed, a constant seeker. What I am seeking? That's the true question. 

In this search I found news and healthy ways of eating. Food is one of my favorites adventures. 

I also discovered that to eat I needed to plant. And that led me to permaculture, bioconstruction and all the old new ways of trying to live in a more sustainable way. My last interest is the world of soapmaking, natural extracts and other goodies for the body.

I studied Social Science in college to try to understand the world, our society. Now, I'm trying to erase all that to finally understand myself. I'm still a student.

I try to compost, recycle, reuse water, save electric energy and meditate. That's the way I found to reduce our impact at the planet. Here I cook, make bread and pizza, do exercises, read books, play music, clean the house, do gardening, make soap and try to be awake in the meanwhile. It's the adventure of being alive.

I love to travel and to meet new people.  Hosting through Airbnb has allowed me to to do both.  

On my free time I like spend time with family and friends, travel and read - biographies and art are my favorite topics,   I also love history, interior decoration and photography.  Lately I have had a growing interest in reading about natural food and natural healing through meditation and yoga.  So I have been spending a lot of time cooking and attending to my herb garden.

I have lived most of my life in Rio. so I know the city well.   Since the 80´s, when I came back from a small liberal arts college in the US where I majored in History and Political Science, I started hosting friends vacationing  in Rio.  I have started hosting visitors from college  every year.   Some were coming for the first time, others came every other year.   This experience has enabled me to see the city through the eyes of new comers.

One day I found the most amazing piece of land, bordered by a river, close to a conservation unit, with amazing lush vegetation and full of different species of palm trees (a personal favorite).
This house is the dream come true. Inspired by gorgeous portuguese colonial style, every little space was carefully thought of and designed by me.
Living in bustling Rio de Janeiro it is the perfect escape into nature, not only because of its deliciousness in general, amazing surroundings, proximity to great beaches (15 minutes), but because it is so close to the city - 42 km, which makes it very simple to pack and go. On a normal day, avoiding rush hour, one takes 50 minutes to get there from Rio.
This a quiet nature retreat, but the neighborhood (Vargem Grande,10 minutes) is considered a Gastronomical Pole with many nice restaurants. The area also has an ample tradition of horseback riding.
Besides the abundant lush nature, waterfalls and great hiking trails, it is close to the best beaches in Rio de Janeiro - Prainha and Grumari, also a surfer's haven, 10km away.";within an hour;100%;;f;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/01060266-6588-4a17-8ea8-30f8c9a838a2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/01060266-6588-4a17-8ea8-30f8c9a838a2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;;1.0;1.0;['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio'];t;t;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;;Vargem Grande;;Rio de Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro;22785;Rio De Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;BR;Brazil;-22.961641681596515;-43.48965572103401;t;House;Entire home/apt;6;2.0;3.0;6.0;Real Bed;"{Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Pool,Kitchen,""Free parking on premises"",""Pets allowed"",""Indoor fireplace"",""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",Bathtub,""Baby bath"",""Changing table"",""High chair"",""Children’s books and toys"",""Babysitter recommendations"",""Room-darkening shades"",""Children’s dinnerware"",""Game console"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Single level home"",""Patio or balcony"",""Garden or backyard"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Step-free access"",""Wide doorway"",""Flat path to front door"",""Well-lit path to entrance"",""Step-free access"",""Wide clearance to bed"",""Step-free access"",Waterfront,""Lake access""}";;$1,000.00;;;$3,558.00;$240.00;6;$213.00;2;180;a week ago;t;0;0;0;196;2018-04-15;28;2013-04-01;2018-03-03;100.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;f;;;f;f;strict;t;t;1;0.46;4;2018;;;;;;;;;;

Marks lessons:
 A LITTLE ABOUT MARK –
 I learned three lessons that were the keys to my success: •You need to want it ( to accomplish things ) so bad you can taste it
•Surround yourself with successful people
•You need to work your rear-end off
 I try to live my life using three principles I learned the hard way.  •Integrity; do what is right and avoid what’s wrong
•Treat people like you want to be treated
•Do the very best you can every time
 Lessons learned from adversity: •A high personal cost in self-esteem sometimes
•Peer groups you often become associated with are not conducive to your improvement
•Embarrassment is the cost of caring about what people think
•Loneliness when no one understands
 Benefits from adversity: •Gaining patience.  Seldom are you able to accomplish something the first time
•Learning that failing is not bad.  You need to keep trying
•Developing a drive and motivating others
•Developing personal fortitude

About me:
I was born in Brasília and after visiting Rio many years ago I fell in love!! Rio de Janeiro is amazing, so decided to live here.

I am fashion designer and I also love painting as a hobby; when you visit I can show u my work.
I've also lived in Norway and visited Europe many times,  I love meeting new people with different culture. I'm very open-minded, have a lot of good friends and I´d be happy to show you around and go out have fun!

I have past experiences receiving people from Couchsurfing too, so I have no doubt you´d have a very good experience staying in my place!

My husband, Andre, and I have an amazing 5 year old daughter who is our everything.  

I first came to Rio in 2003 for work in the Fashion industry.  It just so happened my now husband was my then agent.  He showed me the local style of Rio and I instantly feel in love.  Well, at first with the City and the country and later him. : )  

I currently have a business teaching english conversation to kids while doing all kinds of American crafts, games, theater, and cooking.  I am also starting a professional organizing service as well.  My husband(Andre) has his own company for 18 years Importing and Exporting here in Rio.  

Andre, is a huge water guy, he surfs stand-up, Kite and short board.  He is a triathlete.  Needless to say we spend most of our time outside, at the beach or around the beach life style.  I on the other hand, love Yoga, meditation, cooking, gardening, a good book, dance, good wine, fashion, interior design and most of all travel! 

We are fortunate to be a family that travels internationally many times each year.  My daughter is already bilingual and working on her third language, (mandrin).  We spend most of our time here in Rio but also travel to the US, mainly St. Louis Missouri(where my family lives) and in Los Angeles (where I lived for 20 years).  We also travel to Asia regularly and plan to live there for 3 months this year.  

In one of my many past careers I was a professional Dancer and had the good fortune of working for a famous band.  I traveled all over the world for 5 years.  It was a special time and an honer and a pleasure to have the experience of knowing so many incredible placed and people.  It would be very hard to pick one but I must say the Magical Island of Bali is my all time favorite.   I am already planning our family trip around the world when my daughter turns 10.  

We hope to see you here in Rio Soon
Peace and Blessings,
Sherri, Andre and Bella";within a day;100%;;f;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/249439/profile_pic/1411412918/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/249439/profile_pic/1411412918/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;Joá;21.0;21.0;['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio'];t;t;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;Recreio dos Bandeirantes;Recreio dos Bandeirantes;;Rio de Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro;;Rio De Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;BR;Brazil;-23.031627557672508;-43.47938481451544;f;Apartment;Entire home/apt;4;2.5;2.0;3.0;Real Bed;"{TV,""Cable TV"",""Air conditioning"",Pool,Kitchen,""Free parking on premises"",Gym,Elevator,""Hot tub"",""Family/kid friendly"",Washer}";;$437.00;;;$2,561.00;$256.00;4;$171.00;2;90;11 months ago;t;29;59;89;364;2018-04-15;3;2014-07-15;2015-09-21;87.0;9.0;9.0;10.0;10.0;8.0;9.0;f;;;f;f;strict;t;t;19;0.07;4;2018;;;;;;;;;;

I was a Chief Master Sergeant. I`m an English Teacher, Psychologist and Sculptor as well.
Moreover, I have two B.A. on Psychology and Portuguese and English Language and Literature and yet a MBA on Environmental Education!
At the moment, I`ve been making studies on ""Environmental Education"".
Concerning my way of living, I could say the following:
- I do love travelling around the world, meeting and coming closer to different People and Cultures. That`s why, I`m working as a Tourist Guide;
- I usually like being around ""People"" who are able to conduct a true conversation, yet do not take themselves too ""seriously"". After all, as Fritz Perls, the Father of Gestalt Therapy always affirmed: I`m not here in this Planet to live under your expectations and neither do you. I am ME and You are YOU! If We meet ourselves by any chance, that`s okay, that is, each one of Us has a highway to ride!
- A decent sense of humour is an absolute must.
- Since I came to this Planet, I realized that I had two shortcuts: Through Pain or Love! That's why I decided to be an Easygoing person, True-hearted, Funny, Adventurous, Optimistic, Realistic, Sensible, Thoughtful, however, too Emotional.
- Last Year, I had the opportunity to rent a flat through Airbnb in Amsterdam. It was my first time doing that and i was very lucky to have a host like CLAUDIA who became a ""friend"" of mine.

And at last, the Best Gift I can give You it's a ""Hug"". It's an unique size and I don't mind if You gimme it back!
God Bless all of You!

Amo viajar, conhecer novos lugares, sua gente, seus costumes. Adoro esportes, natureza, cozinhar, cinema, luz do sol e gente honesta. Procuro olhar o outro como eu gostaria de ser olhada. 

Nesse mundo de mudanças rápidas, tenho buscado entender mais sobre sustentabilidade, inteligência artificial e física quântica. Quem sabe isso não irá me ajudar um pouco mais da vida?

Tudo o que eu faço, procuro fazer com amor. Amo minha família e desejo ser feliz a cada dia.

Decidi alugar este apartamento para viajantes como eu, que desejem experimentar a cidade como um verdadeiro morador e não somente como turista.

Como host, tento promover o bem estar para as pessoas que recebo, colocando atenção e carinho nos mínimos detalhes, gerando um ambiente aconchegante e acolhedor de um lar.

Meu objetivo é que meus hóspedes tenham a sensação de estar chegando em uma casa com alma, que poderia ser a casa deles.

English - I'm a Carioca (native born in Rio), an architect and my passport is always ready to hit the road.

I love to travel, to know new places, its people, its customs. I love sports, nature, cooking, cinema, sunlight and honest people. I try to look at other people as I would like to be looked at.

In this world of very fast changes, I have sought to understand more about sustainability, artificial intelligence, and quantum physics. Who knows, it will help me understand life a little bit better?

Everything I do, I seek to do with love. I love my family and I want to be happy every day.

I decided to rent this apartment for travelers like myself, who want to experience the city as a true resident and not only as a tourist. Rio de Janeiro is a magic city and I still believe we can enjoy the better it has to offer: beauty, relax, good vibes, nice people, music and much more.

As a host, I try to promote well-being for my guests, pouring attention and affection in the smallest details, generating a warm and welcoming home environment.

My goal is to give my guests the feeling of being in a house with a soul that could be their own home.";within an hour;100%;;t;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a6abcd6b-6eb9-43e7-a0f9-b417376ab1e0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a6abcd6b-6eb9-43e7-a0f9-b417376ab1e0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;Copacabana;2.0;2.0;['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id'];t;t;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;Copacabana;Copacabana;;Rio de Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro;22081-010;Rio De Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;BR;Brazil;-22.983715592038397;-43.19458502850025;t;Apartment;Entire home/apt;7;2.0;3.0;4.0;Real Bed;"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",""Wheelchair accessible"",Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Changing table"",""Children’s books and toys"",""Window guards"",""Babysitter recommendations"",""Pack ’n Play/travel crib"",""Room-darkening shades"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Single level home"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Wide hallway clearance"",""Wide doorway"",""Flat path to front door"",""Well-lit path to entrance"",""Step-free access"",""Wide clearance to bed"",""Accessible-height bed"",""Host greets you""}";;$369.00;;;$500.00;$105.00;2;$90.00;2;27;today;t;22;52;82;331;2018-04-14;25;2012-12-24;2018-04-02;98.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;f;;;f;f;strict;f;f;2;0.39;4;2018;;;;;;;;;;

My husband, Andre, and I have an amazing 5 year old daughter who is our everything.  

I first came to Rio in 2003 for work in the Fashion industry.  It just so happened my now husband was my then agent.  He showed me the local style of Rio and I instantly feel in love.  Well, at first with the City and the country and later him. : )  

I currently have a business teaching english conversation to kids while doing all kinds of American crafts, games, theater, and cooking.  I am also starting a professional organizing service as well.  My husband(Andre) has his own company for 18 years Importing and Exporting here in Rio.  

Andre, is a huge water guy, he surfs stand-up, Kite and short board.  He is a triathlete.  Needless to say we spend most of our time outside, at the beach or around the beach life style.  I on the other hand, love Yoga, meditation, cooking, gardening, a good book, dance, good wine, fashion, interior design and most of all travel! 

We are fortunate to be a family that travels internationally many times each year.  My daughter is already bilingual and working on her third language, (mandrin).  We spend most of our time here in Rio but also travel to the US, mainly St. Louis Missouri(where my family lives) and in Los Angeles (where I lived for 20 years).  We also travel to Asia regularly and plan to live there for 3 months this year.  

In one of my many past careers I was a professional Dancer and had the good fortune of working for a famous band.  I traveled all over the world for 5 years.  It was a special time and an honer and a pleasure to have the experience of knowing so many incredible placed and people.  It would be very hard to pick one but I must say the Magical Island of Bali is my all time favorite.   I am already planning our family trip around the world when my daughter turns 10.  

We hope to see you here in Rio Soon

 I love to travel, since I lived in Madrid, Spain as well, it always traveled a lot and all over Europe playing tournaments and tennis for several times I was in airbnb, like to have contact with local people and learn their culture.
 Also I traveled for several months looking for a city to live in Asia, also to know more about their culture. I loved Thailand, Philippines and Japan, Bali. But not for living, after that experience I decided to move back to live in Rio, I have arranged an apartment in Barra da Tijuca and that's when I decided to rent the room to continue to have contact with people around the world.  
 I am a very healthy person, I love cooking, my favorite food are Seafood, fish, and love all brazilian fruits.
My philosophy is  living and seeking to escape the stress.
Sport is fundamental part of my life, I also love dance, music and Carnaval in Rio. Also like going out to meet my friends, talking, movies, beach, bike and mainly play tennis, beach tennis.

Uma das praias mais famosas da cidade, perde em popularidade apenas para a praia de Copacabana, onde é realizado todos os anos o reveillon da cidade. Ipanema inspirou o compositor Vinícius de Moraes quando lançou a canção Garota de Ipanema, da qual Tom Jobim foi responsável pela melodia. Além de ser um ponto de encontro tradicional para moradores e turistas, a praia é utilizada para a prática de diversos esportes. Entre as atividades favoritas estão o skiboard surf, frescobol, vôlei, futebol, futevôlei. Os principais campeonatos de vôlei de praia são transmitidos para todo o Brasil. A praia também é palco de shows ao ar livre, que acontecem à noite perto do canal que divide o bairro do Leblon. Vão desde concertos de música clássica a apresentações de artistas consagrados.

Viviane is a photographer for Lonely Planet. And also a photographer for Airbnb and an Airbnb host. And a free lance photographer for other wonderful clients. She loves life.

Eduardo - you may occasionally bump into him for your check ins/out - is a M.I.T. (Musicians Institute of Technology) graduate from Los Angeles and plays the best guitar you'll ever hear. Just ask him! Fluent in English, a true carioca full of stories to share.

We  work together in providing the best accommodation to people. You could meet just Viviane. Or exchange messages with her. Or Katia.  Or you could book and meet Katia. Or book with Viviane and meet Eduardo for your check in. Or all of us depending on who's around. 

We're great at what we do because we care and we like the type of people Airbnb brings to us. And with almost 500 positive reviews (wow!), we kind of know by now that guests like us too. 

Just like you, we're also independent travelers always looking for the new next thing.

Voila!

We can't live without: love, travel, cameras, movies, music, a good laugh and cool people. Did we say dark chocolate?

Firm believers of positivity as a prime attitude towards life!

Thank you, Fabbio for hosting me! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location is convenient. The cable television and internet connection worked well. When I had a problem connecting to the internet Fabbio came by and hooked me up. FALA (Friends And Love Always), Fabbio!

Sou muito grata pelos dias que fiquei hospedada em Copacabana, apartamento é muito funcional e comportou todas as minhas necessidades. Realmente é perto de tudo e super seguro! Consegui ficar próxima de pontos turísticos paradisíacos e me localizar facilmente. O anfitrião Fabbio se mostrou muito atencioso e tirava minhas duvidas com prontidão antes e durante a estadia. Certamente voltarei para desfrutar ainda mais desta cidade que me encantou!!! :)

Excelente anfitrião, atensioso e prestativo. O apartamento é exatamente como na foto e super bem localizado.
De Recife, Brasil · Abril de 2015

O apartamento do Fabbio é ótimo. Muito espaçoso e bem localizado, fica próximo à estação do metrô, que me permitiu ir ao centro e praia com muita facilidade. O Fabbio é muito prestativo e atencioso, respondeu e atendeu minhas solicitações com grande rapidez. Recomendo muito!
==========

Eu e meu filho ficamos 07 dias em Copacabana e amamos a hospedagem. O anfitrião Fábio nos deixou à vontade nos dias que permanecemos na cidade e, por outro lado quando precisamos de algo estava pronto para ajudar. O apartamento é localizado próximo de tudo: supermercado, metrô, praia, lojas, bancos, etc. Isso facilitou nossa vida nos dias em que ficamos na cidade, mesmo sem conhecer. Achei também muito legal o fato de ter tudo que precisei no apartamento, me sentindo em casa. Outro detalhe, são os porteiros do prédio que são muito gentis. O prédio em si é um ambiente muito agradável e (website hidden) certeza, voltarei em outras ocasiões e com o resto da família! Só que agora já tenho onde ficar. :)

O apartamento é muito bom, tal como nas fotos. Estava limpo e é muito bem localizado. Recomendo!

Aunque no tuve la oportunidad de conocer personalmente a Fábbio, él siempre fue muy atento en contestar todas mis dudas antes de mi reservación, y durante nuestra estancia, siempre al pendiente. Un anfitrión con experiencia, nos ha recibido con muchas bebidas, galletas y deliciosos dulces! El (website hidden) tal como se describe en las fotos, está muy bien ubicado, un barrio tranquilo, muy cerca de la playa de Copacabana y de la estación del subte, con supermercados, restaurantes, todo a corta distancia. Es un excelente punto de partida para explorar Río de Janeiro. La cocina pequeña pero tiene todos los utensilios necesarios para poder preparar alimentos, incluso nos consiguió algunos que le hemos solicitado, muy amable de su parte. Es un apto. cómodo, con buena ventilación, aunque la segunda recamara no posee ventada, también se duerme bien, muy bien equipado y con buen WIFI. En general, yo disfrute mucho de mi estancia en este apto. durante los quince días que estuve en Río de Janeiro, nunca fallo nada, lo recomiendo ampliamente!
==========

Clear instructions re address, very helpful doorman rang Fabio so we could gain access to apartment. apartment was as described, we really enjoyed our stay and the effort Fabio went to leaving drinks and snacks, even toiletries. Very clean and the air con blocked out any noise from the street so we had good sleeps, nice strong shower, good plumbing which is not always the case in brasil we understand, I would highly recommend Fabio and his accomadation to friends and fellow travelors, we would definitely stay again if we come back to rio. awesome location a few blocks back from the beach on a nice tree lined road.
==========

Fabbio was one of the best host I met in airbnb. Always ready to help and to give nice suggestion. His apartment is very stylish and located 5 minutes walking from copacabana beach in a safe area with everything you could need. Wifi was working perfectly and apartment was fully equipped.
==========

He space was really great and Fabbio was a fantastic host! He asked us what kind of snacks/drinks we liked and had the kitchen stocked for us, the space is only a few blocks from Copacabana and never had a hard time getting a taxi outside to go explore anywhere else. Would definitely stay again and would further recommend any space hosted by Fabbio. 
==========

Excelente apartamento, el anfitrión nos atendió de la manera más generosa y sin dejar de lado ningún detalle para que nuestra estadía fuera la más placentera... Recomiendo el apartamento y al anfitrión al 100%
==========

We enjoyed our stay at Fábbio's place. The location was perfect. It was a quick walk to the beach, and there were great neighborhood restaurants. Fábbio was a great host, very attentive.
==========

Excelente anfitrión, el departamento estaba muy limpio y bien ubicad.
==========

Fantastic place! Everything is within walking distance. Perfect for a couple or couple with small children. Although I didn't get to meet Fabbio in person, he was easily contactable. Checked in early and left late with no added penalty. Great place to stay, look no further.
==========

Estive com um grupo de 6 pessoas durante o feriado da Páscoa e a acomodação foi muito tranquila. Fábbio foi super receptivo deixando um bilhete de boas vindas, alguns snacks e bebidas para nós e sempre respondeu as mensagens prontamente. O apartamento é exatamente o que aparece nas fotos. O segundo quarto é menor, fica na área de serviço e não possui ar-condicionado, mas tem um ventilador e um triliche e é super tranquilo. Possui ar condicionado no quarto maior e na sala ( que tem um sofá-cama muito bom!!). A cozinha é bem equipada, apenas sugiro um micro-ondas para os viajantes preguiçosos e em busca dos congelados pra ganhar tempo na cidade Maravilhosa!! Os porteiros são amigáveis; a localização é ótima, ficando a 1 quadra do metrô Siqueira Campos e a uns 10 minutinho de caminhada até a praia. Tem uma estação da Bike Rio no metrô Siqueira Campos ( vale muito a pena fazer o cadastro e percorrer a orla de bike!). Próximo a ponto de ônibus (website hidden) vizinhança tem supermercados, farmácias,lanchonetes e restaurantes. Foi minha primeira experiência e eu voltaria com certeza. Valeu Fábbio, sucesso aí!
==========

Fabbio was an excellent host. The apartment is exactly what Fabbio advertised and the whole experience, including the booking, ran easily as Fabbio was very helpful and easygoing. I would definitely stay at Fabbios again, very good location just a short walk from Copacabana Beach.

I live in Rio - the most beautiful city of the world. I love to live in a city where you feel like always being on vacation, because of the scent of the see and friendly people.
I studied Business Administration and Accounting and used to work with external and internal audit, but nowadays I'm much more involved with my family, remodeling, Airbnb and private projects. At this moment I'm studying interior design.
When possible, I like to going out for dinner, to dance, to cinemas, theaters, etc
I was born in Rio and has been living in Copacabana since. I moved to Sao Paulo for 5 years and then moved back to Rio.
Rio has many options of entertainment - for adults and children, for sunny or rainy days. The city was really blessed - nature here is really great.
I love to travel and visit different places. Not only for pleasure but also for work.
Due to my little children (a girl and a boy) long distance travels were suspended for a while, but now we are starting again.
If you are planning to visit Rio and if it is your first time, it will be my pleasure to receive you here and mainly if you choose my apt it will be great!
In case you need any help, have any doubts, please feel free to ask.

Vivi oito anos no sul da França em Avignon et Montpellier (de 1992 até 2000) com meu marido, ele é francês, ele se chama Bruno, nós dois somos professores de francês.
Gostamos  muito de música de um modo geral, apreciamos a MPB, gostamos também de cinema e de visitar a natureza, já fomos várias vezes ao Jardim Botânico, Parque Lage e Parque da Cidade em Niterói, sobretudo acompanhando amigos de fora  e ... 
Sugiro as pessoas irem visitar os seguintes lugares: Forte de Copacabana, Forte do Leme, o Parque da Catacumba, o Parque da Cidade em Niterói, o Museu Casa do Pontal no Recreio, o Parque das Ruínas em Santa Teresa, nesses passeios desfrutamos de uma vista muito bonita, além de estarmos em contato com a natureza ...
Gostamos de viajar e juntos já fomos à Suiça (Francesa) e República Tcheca (Praga) e já visitamos outras cidades na França(Paris, Le Mans,Lyon, Marseille, Nice,La Rochelle, Île d'Oléron...).
Eu já fui à Espanha (Barcelona, Madrid), Holanda ( Amsterdam, Roterdam, Delft, Gouda). 
Aprecio comidas típicas brasileiras: Feijoada, Carne de Sol com aipim (Bar do Arnaudo-Santa Teresa, Mercadinho São José -Laranjeiras), Carne Seca com Abóbora, Escondidinho, Camarão na Moranga,  e logicamente comida baiana (Vatapá, Acarajé,Bobó de Camarão, Xinxim de galinha, Carurú ) que podemos encontrar  junto às baianas e seus tabuleiros no Largo da Carioca, Feira Hippie e no Largo do Machado com o baiano Fernando.
Lugares preferidos: Feiras de artesanato :Feira Hippie de Ipanema, Feira do Lavradio (primeiro sábado de cada mês), Feira de São Cristóvão (Forró-tipo de dança do nordeste) ...
Gosto muito de dançar, porque como diz o ditado: quem canta e dança os males espanta, adoro Carnaval e festas típicas (São João)... 
Gosto de fazer caminhadas e também andar de bicicleta.
Para os apreciadores de Chorinho, sugiro dar uma  volta na Praça São Salvador aos domingos(manhã e tarde) para escutá-lo ou ainda ir escutá-lo na Praia Vermelha aos sábados pela manhã, o que é uma boa pedida, aproveitando para fazer a pequena caminhada pela pista Claudio Coutinho também conhecida como Caminho dos Bem Te Vi.
E se ainda desejar fazer uma caminhada maior pode-se dalí partir para a subida do morro da Urca (Pão de Açúcar)...

If you turn on the tap, it automatically turns on the gas, but it is important to leave the window in the bathroom ALWAYS open for safety reasons, even when you leave the apartment. This is a rule of the gas company. 2 – There is an air conditioner in the bed room, it is very important that you turn off the air conditioner when you leave the apartment in order for it not to break. If the air conditioning breaks, it can take long to fix and you will ended up staying without cold temperature in the room. As soon as you turn it on, it will refrigerate the room very fast. Another tip is to leave the door of the bathroon always closed, so the bed room will be colder when the air conditioner is on.  3 – The fan in the ceiling is enough to refrigerate the living room.  4 – The window in the kitchen shall always be left open too because of the natural gas installation in the st;;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/11305487/db86036f_original.jpg?aki_policy=large;;3914304;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3914304;Silvia E Sidiney;2012-10-18;Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil;I am 44 years old, I have a baby who is 9 months old.

Meu nome é Brux e sou Italiano.  Estudei no Instituto de Arte na Italia e na universidade da Ciência do Esporte. Apos me formar, decidi me mudar para a Califórnia, onde eu ganhei um Bacharel em Marketing e fiz um Mestrado em Relações Públicas.  Foi chefe do departamento criativo e de marketing da Giorgio Armani em Milão durante 7 anos, e fiz consultorias para outras empresas Italianas e Americanas do luxo. Em 2007 me mudei para o Rio de Janeiro para relaxar.  Agora faço consultoria para empresas de moda internacionais que querem entrar no Brasil, para empresas brasileiras na área de imagem e marketing, e para pessoas na área de design de interiores. Comecei em Airbnb em 2010 como guest em São Paulo, e foi nesse momento que decidi que queria ser um anfitrião também. Comprei um estúdio e coloquei no airbnb quando em Ipanema havia 9 anúncio e no Rio cerca de cem, agora há quase 50.000.  Adorei a experiência e tenho acompanhados a trajectória de airbnb com interesse e emoção. Realmente gosto de encontrar meus convidados e dar eles dicas e truques sobre o Rio.  Mas nao e' sempre que consigo ... ai minha ajudante Rita os encontra para mim, ou também deixo as chaves em um Master Lock para permitir o check-in autônomo.  Em 2017, fui convidado a ser Líder do Clube de Anfitriões do Rio de Janeiro, juntamente com outros 2 hosts. Organizamos encontros, ajudamos novos hosts a configurar as próprias listagens ou preparamos listas de ajudas sobre como o usuário pode aproveitar melhor a plataforma. Foi uma experiência muito gratificante que me colocou em contato com a equipe da airbnb no Brasil e me deu acesso a mais informações sobre a empresa e seus acontecimentos. Tem sido uma viagem incrível e uma experiência que mudou minha vida.  Estou definitivamente feliz de todas as notícias e novos produtos que airbnb está lançando.

My name is Brux and I was born in Italy.  I studied in the italian art highschool and Sport Science University.  I then moved to California where I gained a bachelor in Marketing and took a Master's in Public Relations.  I headed the creative services and marketing department of Giorgio Armani in Milan for 7 years, and I did consultancies for other italian and american companies.  I then moved to Rio de Janeiro in 2007 to relax.  Now I do consulting for international fashion companies who wants to enter into Brazil, for Brazilian companies in the area of image and marketing, and for privates in the area of interior design.  I started on Airbnb in 2010 as a guest in Sao Paolo and decided I wanted to be a host as well.  I bought a studio and put in on airbnb when in Ipanema there were 9 listing and in Rio around one hundred, now there are almost 50.000.  I really enjoyed the experience and accompanied the airbnb trajectory with interest and excitement.  I really like to meet my guest and gives them tips and tricks about Rio. But sometimes I am not able... so my help Rita cheers them for me, or I use a Master Lock for self check in. Em 2017, I was asked to be Leader of the Host Club of Rio de Janeiro together with other 2 hosts.  We organize encounters, help new hosts set up their listing, or prepare how-to-do lists for user of the platform.  It has been a very rewarding experience that put me in contact with the airbnb team in Brazil and gave me access to more information about the company and its growths.  It has been an amazing trip and experience that changed my life and I am definitely happy of all the news and new products that airbnb is launching.

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio
