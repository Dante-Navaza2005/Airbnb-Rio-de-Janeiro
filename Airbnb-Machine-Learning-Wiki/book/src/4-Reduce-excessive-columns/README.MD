# Steps underwent in treating the data

This data science project follows an eight-step process:

1. **Problem Definition** : Clearly articulate the challenge or business question to address with data-driven insights.
2. **Domain Understanding** : Acquire in-depth knowledge of the business area or industry context, focusing on key stakeholders and processes.
3. **Data Acquisition** : Extract the relevant dataset from available sources, ensuring it meets the project requirements.
4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** : Perform data transformation, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies to prepare for analysis.
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : Conduct comprehensive EDA to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.
6. **Model Development** : Construct and train machine learning models using appropriate algorithms and techniques to meet the project objectives.
7. **Result Interpretation** : Analyze the model outputs, validate the results, and extract actionable insights.
8. **Deployment and Production** : Implement the final model in a production environment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and monitoring capabilities.
