# Defining if it is classification or regression problem

Taking into consideration the definitions explained in the previous section:

* Regression models predict a continuous numerical value.
* Classification models predict a discrete category or class label.

Given that our objective is to predict the final price of a property according to its attributes such as localization, number of amenities, etc, we can conclude that our goal is to solve a **regression problem**.
