# About Me

Hello! My name is Dante Navaza, and I am a passionate computer science student at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC Rio). I am fascinated by technology, programming, and machine learning, and I am excited about using these tools to create innovative solutions that can positively impact the world.

## My Interests

I have a strong interest in machine learning, game development, and data analysis. I enjoy exploring different algorithms and frameworks to understand how they work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems. I also have experience and interest in other areas of computer science, such as software development and web development.

## My Skills

* **Programming Languages** : Proficient in Python and C#, with experiences in Java, C, and Javascript
* **Game development:** Proficient using the Unity Framework and 3d modeling tools such as Blender and ZBrush
* **Data Analysis Tools** : Proficient with Pandas, Numpy, graphing tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, Scikitlearn
* **Software Development** : Knowledge of software engineering principles and version control systems like Git
* **Deployment Platforms** : Experience with various deployment platforms and methods such as Streamlit and Render.
* **Multiple languages:** Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese

## My Experience

I have worked on several projects during my studies. Some include:

* **Automation** **projects** in which a algorithm creates a report and automatically sends it via email to a desired user
* **Machine learning projects** where i devloped a predictive model to predict the future sales of a company
* **Web development** in which i'm currently building my own portfolio and ecommerce websites
* **Game development**: I have developed 5 complete games in Unity and Construct 3d

## My Goals

As I continue my studies, I aim to further develop my skills especially in machine learning and related fields, which is why I decided to develop this project. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to projects that have a positive social or environmental impact, such as this one which aims to help airbnb renters and property owners.
