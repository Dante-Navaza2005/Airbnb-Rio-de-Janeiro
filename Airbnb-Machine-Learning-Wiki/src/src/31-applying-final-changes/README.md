# Applying the final changes

Finally, after implementing all necessary feature modifications, proceed with training the model to evaluate its performance in terms of **efficiency** and **accuracy**. If you wish to conduct comparative analysis with an alternative model to assess whether it outperforms the Extra Trees algorithm, you may consider using a **Random Forest Regressor** for this purpose, but feel free to choose **whichever** model you prefer!

After all the changes are done, we can move on to the final deployment fase.
