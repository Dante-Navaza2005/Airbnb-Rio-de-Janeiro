## Future plans

Having finished this large machine learning project, I will now refocus on other projects I had in progress:

* **E-commerce Website** : Im currently working on an e-commerce platform designed to offer a seamless shopping experience. This project aims to provide a user-friendly environment where people can find and purchase unique products containing a full integration will banking systems.
* **Portfolio Website** : In addition to this project, I'm developing my portfolio website to showcase my work in technology, machine learning, and other creative endeavors. This platform will serve as a central hub for my professional achievements and personal projects.
* **New Game Development** : I'm currently working on a photorealistic third person action game that portrays a alien invasion cenario using a large variety of technologies such as Unity, Blender, Character Creator 4, and ZBrush.
