# Comparing the results of the models and choosing the best one

Taking into consideration the evaluation metrics mentioned in the second section we will:

* First choose 1 main metric, such as R², in which the model with the biggest R² will be considered the best model
* RSME will be used as a tiebreaker when models have very similar R²
* Time and complexity will also be taken into consideration (less time and less information needed is prefered)
